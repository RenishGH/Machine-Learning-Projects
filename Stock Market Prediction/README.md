# Stock Market Prediction

I developed this machine learning project to predict stock market trends using historical price data. Stock price forecasting is a challenging task due to market volatility, but it can provide valuable insights for investors and analysts.

## Introduction

Predicting stock prices involves analyzing historical data and identifying patterns that can help estimate future movements. In this project, I applied time series analysis and machine learning techniques to forecast stock prices and detect trends.

---

## Project Overview

My key objectives include:

- Collecting and exploring historical stock market data  
- Engineering features relevant to price movement  
- Applying machine learning models for prediction  
- Evaluating performance using regression metrics  

---

## Dataset

I used historical stock data that includes:

- Open, high, low, and close prices  
- Trading volume  
- Date and time stamps  

I performed preprocessing such as handling missing values, creating lag features, and normalizing price data.

## Methodology

To predict stock price trends, I followed these steps:

- Data visualization and trend analysis  
- Feature creation based on moving averages and past price behavior  
- Splitting the data into training and test sets based on time  
- Applying machine learning models including:  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor  
- Evaluating using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score  

---

## Results

The Gradient Boosting Regressor achieved the best performance, with a low MAE and a strong R² score, indicating a good fit on the test data. Visualizations of actual vs. predicted prices helped evaluate the model’s effectiveness in capturing short-term trends. While no model can perfectly predict the market, this project demonstrated the potential of data-driven approaches for stock forecasting.
