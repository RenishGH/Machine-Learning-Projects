## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, online advertising is a primary revenue stream for many businesses. Understanding user behavior—specifically their likelihood of clicking on ads—is vital for advertisers to maximize their return on investment. This project aims to build a predictive model that identifies the probability of a user clicking on an ad, enabling more targeted and efficient advertising strategies.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that classifies whether a user will click on a given advertisement. The process typically involves:

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gathering relevant user and ad features, cleaning the data, and preparing it for model training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Applying machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
- **Prediction**: Using the trained model to estimate click-through likelihood for new data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various features related to users and advertisements. These features might include:

- **User Information**: Age, gender, income, location, browsing history, etc.
- **Ad Information**: Ad type, category, size, advertiser, etc.
- **Contextual Information**: Time of day, device type, website category, etc.
- **Target Variable**: A binary label indicating whether the ad was clicked (1) or not (0).

> Example:  
> "The dataset `advertising.csv` was obtained from [Kaggle/UCI/Internal Source].  
> It contains X rows and Y columns with features such as `Daily Time Spent on Site`, `Age`, `Area Income`, `Daily Internet Usage`, `Ad Topic Line`, `City`, `Male`, `Country`, `Timestamp`, and `Clicked on Ad`."

## Methodology

This project uses supervised machine learning for binary classification. Common algorithms for ad click prediction include:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks

> Example implementation:  
> "We explored multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. After hyperparameter tuning, the Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest performance.  
> Data preprocessing included handling missing values, one-hot encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical values."
