 I have undertaken a project in which I have created a fabricated dataset representing advertising data. This dataset serves to determine whether a specific internet user clicked on an advertisement displayed on a company's website. My objective was to develop a predictive model that can anticipate the likelihood of a user clicking on an ad based on various user characteristics.

The dataset encompasses the following attributes:

'Daily Time Spent on Site': The duration of time, in minutes, that a consumer spends on the site.
'Age': The age of the customer in years.
'Area Income': The average income of the geographical area where the consumer resides.
'Daily Internet Usage': The average number of minutes per day that the consumer spends on the internet.
'Ad Topic Line': The headline or title of the advertisement.
'City': The city in which the consumer is located.
'Male': An indicator representing whether the consumer is male or not.
'Country': The country to which the consumer belongs.
'Timestamp': The time at which the consumer either clicked on the ad or closed the window.
'Clicked on Ad': A binary value (0 or 1) indicating whether the consumer clicked on the ad or not.
