# Predicting Titanic Survival - Logistic Regression

I developed this machine learning project to predict survival outcomes of passengers on the Titanic using logistic regression. Understanding factors influencing survival can provide valuable insights into this historic tragedy and demonstrate binary classification techniques.

## Introduction

The Titanic dataset is a classic in machine learning. In this project, I build a logistic regression model to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features like age, gender, class, and fare.

---

## Project Overview

My key objectives include:

- Exploring and preprocessing the Titanic dataset  
- Handling missing data and encoding categorical variables  
- Applying logistic regression for binary classification  
- Evaluating model performance using classification metrics  

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains passenger information with features such as:

- Passenger class  
- Sex  
- Age  
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard  
- Number of parents/children aboard  
- Fare paid  
- Survival status (target variable)  

I clean and prepare the data to ensure accuracy in modeling.

## Methodology

I perform the following steps:

- Data cleaning and feature engineering  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Splitting data into training and test sets  
- Training a logistic regression model  
- Evaluating with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

---

## Results

I summarize the logistic regression model's performance and provide visualizations like ROC curves and confusion matrices.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn
