# Identify Iris Flower

I developed this machine learning project to classify iris flowers into their species based on measurements of their petals and sepals. Accurate classification of iris flowers is a classic problem in machine learning and helps demonstrate fundamental classification techniques.

## Introduction

The iris flower classification problem is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community. In this project, I build models to classify iris flowers into species such as Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica using their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

---

## Project Overview

My key objectives include:

- Exploring and preprocessing the iris dataset  
- Visualizing relationships between features  
- Applying classification algorithms to accurately identify flower species  
- Evaluating model performance using classification metrics  

---

## Dataset

The dataset I use is the classic Iris dataset containing measurements of iris flowers with the following features:

- Sepal length  
- Sepal width  
- Petal length  
- Petal width  
- Species (target variable)  

I clean and prepare the data to ensure it is ready for modeling.

## Methodology

I apply various classification algorithms such as:

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

My preprocessing steps include encoding the target variable and splitting the data into training and test sets. I evaluate the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

I present the model evaluation metrics and visualize the classification results, including confusion matrices and feature importance.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn
