# Private vs Public University

I developed this machine learning project to classify universities as private or public based on various features such as tuition fees, enrollment, graduation rates, and more. This classification helps in understanding key differences and predicting university types.

## Introduction

Classifying universities into private or public categories provides insights into their characteristics and can support decision-making for students and policymakers. In this project, I build models to predict a universityâ€™s type based on available data.

---

## Project Overview

My key objectives include:

- Exploring and preprocessing university data  
- Visualizing differences between private and public institutions  
- Applying classification algorithms to predict university type  
- Evaluating model performance with classification metrics  

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains university-level data with features such as:

- Tuition fees  
- Enrollment numbers  
- Graduation rates  
- Faculty details  
- Other institutional attributes  
- University type (private or public) as the target variable  

I clean and prepare the data for modeling by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

---

## Methodology

I apply several classification algorithms including:

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  

The preprocessing involves feature selection, encoding, and splitting the data into training and test sets. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

---

## Results

My models achieved strong classification performance, with accuracy scores typically above 85%. The Random Forest Classifier yielded the best results, demonstrating high precision and recall for both private and public university classes. Visualizations such as confusion matrices and feature importance plots helped to interpret model behavior and key influencing factors.
