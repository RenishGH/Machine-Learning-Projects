## Introduction

The housing market is influenced by numerous factors that affect property prices. This project builds predictive models to estimate house prices by analyzing features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant attributes.

---

## Project Overview

Key objectives include:

- Cleaning and preprocessing housing data  
- Feature engineering to improve model inputs  
- Applying regression models to predict property prices  
- Evaluating models based on performance metrics  
- Visualizing feature importance and prediction accuracy  

---

## Dataset

The dataset includes detailed records of houses with features like:

- Location  
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms  
- Square footage  
- Year built  
- Lot size  
- Other property attributes  

The data has been processed to handle missing values and categorical variables appropriately.
