# Movie Recommendation System

I developed this machine learning project to build a movie recommendation system that suggests films based on user preferences. Recommender systems are widely used in platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube to personalize user experiences and increase engagement.

## Introduction

With the explosion of digital content, users often struggle to find movies theyâ€™ll enjoy. In this project, I created a recommendation system that helps users discover new movies by analyzing patterns in user behavior and content similarities.

---

## Project Overview

My key objectives include:

- Exploring and cleaning the movie dataset  
- Creating a recommendation engine using collaborative and/or content-based filtering  
- Evaluating the quality of recommendations  
- Enhancing user experience through relevant suggestions  

---

## Dataset

The dataset includes information such as:

- Movie titles  
- Genres  
- Ratings  
- User interactions (for collaborative filtering)  

I cleaned and prepared the data to ensure consistency, removed duplicates, handled missing values, and formatted text fields appropriately for processing.

## Methodology

I implemented different types of recommendation systems:

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommending movies based on similarity of genres, keywords, and overviews  
- **Collaborative Filtering** (if applicable): Using user-item interaction matrices to suggest movies based on similar users' preferences  

Steps involved:

- Text vectorization using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer  
- Cosine similarity computation for content matching  
- Filtering and ranking recommendations for each user

## Results

The recommendation engine provided relevant movie suggestions for a variety of user inputs. Content-based filtering worked especially well for users without prior history (cold start), while collaborative filtering showed promising results when user interaction data was available. The system was able to return top-n movie suggestions in real-time with good accuracy and diversity.
